# Project Name: Student Performance Prediction
# Introduction:
This Python project aims to predict students' final grades (G3) based on various factors such as their previous grades (G1, G2), study time, failures, and absences. This README file provides an overview of the project structure, usage instructions, and conclusions drawn from the predictive model.

# Project Overview:
In this project, we utilize the Pandas library to handle the dataset, which contains information about students' academic performance. We then preprocess the data, selecting relevant features such as G1, G2, study time, failures, and absences, to predict the final grade (G3) using a Linear Regression model.

# Conclusion:
The predictive model achieves a certain accuracy score, indicating how well it performs in predicting students' final grades based on the given features. Additionally, the coefficients and intercept provide insights into the significance of each feature in predicting the final grade. Finally, the model's predictions are compared against the actual values to assess its performance.
